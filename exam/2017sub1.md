(3.5 p) Write a parallel program for solving the n-coloring problem. Find a solution to color n objects
with at most k colors in total, if one exists. Assume you have a function that gets a vector with k 
integers representing the assignment of colors to objects and checks if the constraints are obeyed or not.

/* (2.5 p) Consider the following code for inserting a new value into a linked list at the given position. 
 * We assume that insertion can be called concurrently, but not for the same position. Find and fix the

(3p) We have n servers that can communicate to each other. There are events producing on each of them; 
each event has an associated information. Each server must write a history of all events (server and 
event info) produced on all servers, and, furthermore, the recorded history must be the same for all
servers. Write a distributed algorithm that accomplishes that. Consider the case n=2 for starting.
