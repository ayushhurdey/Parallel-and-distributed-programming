'''
(3.5 p) Write a distributed program, using MPI, that counts the number of k-permutations of N that 
satisfy a given property. 
        You are given a function `bool pred(vector<int> const& v)` that verifies if a given k-permutation satisfies the
 property. Your program shall call that function once for each k-permutation and count the mnumber of times it returns true. 
        For any data structure S that you need to transfer between processes, you are given a function `send(S s, int to)`
that sends an object to a specified process and `void receive(S& s, int& from)` that receives an object and returns it
together with the sender ID.

 are blocked on enqueue if the number of items in the queue reaches a fixed value (say, 100).
