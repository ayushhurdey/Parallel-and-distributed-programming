(3.5 p) Write a distributed program, using MPI, that counts the number of k-permutations of N that 
satisfy a given property. You are given a function `bool pred(vector<int> const& v)` that verifies 
if a given k-permutation satisfies the property. Your program shall call that function once for each 
k-permutation and count the mnumber of times it returns true. Also, for any data structure S that...
